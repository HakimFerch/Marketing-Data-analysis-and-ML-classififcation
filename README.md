# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
I decided to go through with this project after checking the dataset and it made me think of how much of an interesting project this would be as it pushes me to cover multiple aspects
of data science and statistics in general.

The dataset's source: https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective

The aim of this project is to identify customers who are more inclined into making a deposit. The data source provides over 16 personal details about contacted indivduals and their response to the possibility of making a deposit with a yes/no response
I divided the project into 2 parts:
* EDA and inferential statistics where i explore the data, extract insights and determine how features influence the outcome.
* Feature engineering, model selection, implementing the classifcation model and optimizing the model to improve accuracy.
